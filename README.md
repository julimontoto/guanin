## Getting started

### Prerequisites

GUANIN should run under Linux, MacOS and Windows. You'll need Python >= 3.9 installed.

### Installation

Check INSTALL.txt for further details.

## Usage

### The CLI

Open a console and from any path, run the following:

    $ guanin-cli

### The GUI

A simple GUI is included using [pyQT6](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt6/).

From a console, launch the GUI with:

   $ guanin

This *executable* is installed in your PATH (TBD!). You can find it and launch it with a double-click. Although, running it through the console will provide further information about the execution of the program.
