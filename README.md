## Getting started

### Prerequisites

GUANIN should run under Linux, MacOS and Windows. You'll need Python >= 3.9 installed.

## Installation

### Linux

#### Installing with pip

    $ pip install guanin

#### Installing from Repo

    $ git clone https://github.com/julimontoto/guanin.git
  
    $ pip install poetry
  
    $ poetry install

#### [OR] Installing from .whl file

    $ pip install python3-pip
  
    $ pip install --upgrade pip
  
    $ pip install guanin-0.x.x-py3-none-any.whl

### Run

    $ guanin

### MAC

Assuming python ^3.9 is installed.

    % pip install python3-pip
  
    % pip install --upgrade pip
 
    % pip install guanin

### Run

    % guanin


### Windows

Install python3 and pip.
Visual Studio Build Tools 14+ required.

> pip install guanin

#### Run

  > guanin
In case this is not working properly, you will need to find where Guanin has been installed and add it to Path environment variable. (Usually ~/Pythonxxx/scripts)

Check INSTALL.txt for further details.

## Usage

### The CLI

Open a console and from any path, run the following:

    $ guanin-cli

### The GUI

A simple GUI is included using [pyQT6](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt6/).

From a console, launch the GUI with:

   $ guanin

This *executable* is installed in your PATH. You can find it and launch it with a double-click. Although, running it through the console will provide further information about the execution of the program.
